* @Author : Anuragh Reddy Gade
* @Version : v1.1

Automation Developers can  download this framework and start writing your scripts. This framework provides basic project setup ,configuration and Implementation level details on how to proceed with Page Factory Model. 

Tools Used:
1. TestNG
2. Selenium 3.4
3. Maven 
4. geckodriver
5. Maven SureFire Reports

For the purpose of Illustration of details on PageFactory and How it is used,I have considered writing few tests on Google.come Home Page
There are 2 tests that do the following

1. verify the search statistics are displayed on the GoogleSerachResults Page. (i.e Number of search results)
2. Verify that the first search result URL is not Empty.

Obvisiouly you can implement more tests but for those who want to get started on Writing selenium tests,this would be a great starting point.

Feel free to Download and Contribut to this Framework.
